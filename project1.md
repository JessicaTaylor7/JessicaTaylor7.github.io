## Project description

This program is a group project for CSCI 325: Object-Oriented Programming. The project authors include myself, Jacob Hamacher, Bryson Resh, Orion Crosby. My role in this project was creation of the random verse functionality and incorporation of the various classes into the main class. This program allows users to search the Bible, compare Bible translations, compare Bible text with original language, and generate a random Bible verse. This program also offers users a text-to-speech option, implemented using open source software outlined in the project source code. 

## How to run the program

The project was built and tested in the Apache NetBeans IDE 16 environment. It is recommended to use this platform when running the program. To do this, install Apache NetBeans IDE (if not already installed). Next, download the project file and then upload the project file into NetBeans. In the left panel, under 'Projects', select 'BibleLookup'. Then, under Source Packages > biblelookup, select 'BibleLookup.java'. To run the program, click on the green arrow in the top toolbar. A message may appear that reads "The project BibleLookup uses build.properties from another NetBeans installation." - select 'Build Anyway'. The program should start. 


## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
