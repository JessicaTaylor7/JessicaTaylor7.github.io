===============

-   **Class:** CSCI 452

-   **Language(s):** Python
-   **Source Code Repository:** [features/mastering-markdown](https://github.com/JessicaTaylor7/Projects/tree/main/BibleLookup)

## Project description

This program is a project for CSCI 452: Network Penetration Testing & Ethical Hacking. This program allows users to enter a message to be encrypted and then enter the encrypted message to be decrypted back to original form. The program source code is split into separate programs for encryption and decryption. 

## How to run the program

The project was built and tested in the Visual Studio Code environment using Python 3. To run the program using the terminal and Python 3, first change the directory to the directory in which the program files are stored. 

To encrypt a message: python3 MessageEncryption.py

To decrypt a message: python3 MessageDecryption.py

Follow the commands to encrypt/decrypt your message


## UI Design

The user interacts with this program through the command line. When the encryption program is started, the user will be prompted to enter a message to encrypt. After entering a message to encrypt, the program will display the encrypted message. Likewise, when the decryption program is started, the user will be prompted to enter an encrypted message to decrypt. After entering an encrypted message, the program will display the decrypted message. 

Figure 1 shows the encryption/decryption program working with basic one word input: Hello

Figure 2 shows the encryption/decryption program working with basic one sentence input: Felix is my cat

Figure 3 shows the encryption/decryption program working with a slightly longer, but still basic one sentence input: My favorite color is pink

Figure 4 shows the encryption/decryption program working with a basic sentence and a character: I love my pets!

Figure 5 shows the encryption/decryption program working with a basic sentence that includes numbers and characters: Test123..
